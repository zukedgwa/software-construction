** This has a useful pattern/anti-pattern structure that is breif and insightful.
** The list of anti-patterns is breif
*** Filename collision: Filename that are not treated the same in different filesystems
*** Installation required: Build result has an installation process before it can be used
*** Unverified 3rd Party Software: Unverifiable or Untestable  Dependencies
*** Incorrect Dependencies: Dependencies that have to be specified
*** Build-Free Extensiblity: Run-time extensiblities that can be broken without being part of the build 
*** Object-Oriented Builds: Build System can be extended outside of the build system
*** Ignored Error: not detecting and stopping on errors

There are extensive resources on Anti-Patterns
